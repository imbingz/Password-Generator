### Steps to this homework

#### Step 1
After the 'click' event, the users will be prompted to enter the password length. So create a variable that will hold the users input. 
#### Step 2
Check if the users input is a number between 8 and 128. If not(such as letters, null, space, symbols, or numbers out of range), keep prompting until the input is as desired. 
#### Step 3
Ask users whether they would like their passwords to contain numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and symbols. Create a variable to hold each answer (yes=true; no=false). 
#### Step 4
Create a variable that holds the sum of user preference (if yes to any of the options, add those characters to the variable)
#### Step 5
Generate random numbers as index to choose the character randomly. 
#### Step 6
Run the step 5 for the number of times, same as the password length input by the users 
#### Step 7
Create a variable that holds the sum of those random characters. 
#### Step 8
Add the above to the function generatePassword ()
